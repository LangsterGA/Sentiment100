# Sentiment Analysis
First 100 days: a comparison of Donald Trump and Joe Biden

This final project was an opportunity for me to explore a type of Natural Language Processing (NLP) machine learning technique for sentiment analysis. This expanded on the introduction to NLP that we learned in class. Additional challenges were to create a Twitter Developer account and use the credentials to access the Twitter API in order to pull historica tweets via the Python Library "Tweepy". The cleaning, formatting and processing of the data challenged my Python (and many libraries) skills learned during the course. Additionally, the final website was built using my recently learned skills with Bootstrap and required customization to make it visually interesting and user friendly. Finally - I chose to deploy it as a Github as we have done for other projects during class.
