                    <p>In the United States of America, the first 100 days of a presidential term has symbolic
                        significance.
                        This is when a president's specific priorities are defined and parlayed. It is also considered
                        an early
                        indicator to measure their success.</p>
                    <p>The term was originally coined in 1933 by Franklin Delano Roosevelt when he passed 76 laws during
                        his first 100 days.
                        While we won't be looking at their accomplishments during this time, we will consider the
                        messaging of each
                        politician. We want to explore the tone of each politician during this important period, also
                        known as the "honeymoon"
                        period of a presidency.
                        To do this, we will take a look at the Tweets made during the first 100 days for each politician
                        to see how objective and postive each president
                        was. </p>
                    <p>With the help of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we will explore Twitter data using
                        textual
                        featurization, sentiment analysis and word cloud visualizations.
                    </p>
                    <p>The following work employs data from Kaggle, as well as data collected from Twitter using Tweepy.
                        Tweepy is a Python library that allows you to access the Twitter API with a Twitter Developer
                        account
                        and access credentials. The data for Donald Trump is a dataset shared on Kaggle and includes all
                        of his Tweets
                        prior to his account being frozen. The data for Joe Biden was accessed via the Twitter API. Data
                        were cleaned
                        and formatted for analysis using various Python libraries (detailed in Notebooks). Data and Jupyter Notebooks used for
                        the analysis are accessible
                        via the Github link at the bottom of this page.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
                    <p>The main purpose of exploratory data analysis is to better understand the data, look for any
                        patterns,
                        find interesting relationships among the different variables and brainstorm questions about it.
                    </p>
                    <p>Data for each candidate was cleaned and analysed using Python and associated libraries in Jupyter
                        notebooks.
                        Tweets for the first 100 days were
                        queried for each candidate. January 20-April 30, 2017 for Donald Trump and January 20-April 30,
                        2021, for
                        Joe Biden.
                    </p>
                    <p>As a first step, we look at some statistics of the tweets for each politician. The data below are snapshots
                        of the results of the Pandas built-in function df.describe() for the numerical fields in the datasets.
